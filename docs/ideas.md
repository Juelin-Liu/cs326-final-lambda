### 2. Innovative idea:
#### As we move to junior or senior year, lots of students start to consider off-campus housing, but it turns out to be very difficult for students to research among different off-campus housing options and compare their pros and cons. Some common questions are: How much is the rent? How is the public transportation? Is it quiet? There must be lots of questions once people start to consider off-campas living, and we want to make a forum that allows students to share their experences of living off-campus. We noticed that some social media may have the same function as us, for example, on facebook people can also share their post. However on facebook there are so many other information and ads, if people want to find a specific topic it is not really efficient. Also facebook connects a lot of other personal account, which results in that sharing your housing information on facebook may not be a wise choice. So our website will be a relatively safe choice as user account does not have many personal information.

#### (a). User can post their experiences, share pictures, and  make tag and rank for different off-campus living options. 
#### (b). Users can comment on each other's post and start a discussion session below every posts.
#### (c). Users that belong to the same housing area can form smaller group.
The discussion section is structured like a forum - each housing area is a group, where users can create posts and others can respond in a typical thread fashion.

### 3b. If we have time
#### (a). Users looking for someone to sublet to during the summer, or looking for someone to take over their lease after they move out, can post offers for such on a publically available marketplace. Anyone wishing to take up an offer should be able to find their contact information, which should be included in the offer, and thus contact the original poster
