2. Innovative idea:
As we move to junior or senior year, lots of students start to consider off-campus housing, but it turns out to be very difficult for students to research among different off-campus housing options and compare their pros and cons. Like myself, the only resource I had is to ask friends who lives off-campus already about their experences. How is the rent? How is the neighborhood? Is it convenient to get to everywhere? Is it quiet? There must be lots of questions once people start to consider off-campas living. So we want to make a forum that allows students to share their experences of living off-campus. We noticed that some social media may have the same function as us, for example, on facebook people can also share their post. However on facebook there are so many other information and ads, if people want to find a specific topic it is not really efficient. Also facebook connects a lot of other personal account, which results in that sharing your housing information on facebook may not be a wise choice. So our website will be a relatively safe choice as user account does not have many personal information.

3. Important component: 
    a. User can post their experiences, share pictures, and  make tag and rank for different off-campus living options. 
    b. Users can comment on each other's post and start a discussion session below every posts.
    c. Users that belong to the same housing area can form smaller group.
